## About The Project
This project aims to make a text-based adventure game by using **OOP principles(encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance)**. In the game, you can choose the character you want. 
The aim of the game is to collect the rewards of the creatures you kill, to gain equipment and to kill all the creatures in the forest.
